Running knet on FreeBSD
-----------------------

knet requires big socket buffers and you need to set:
kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=18388608
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to run.

For version 12 (or lower), knet requires also:
net.inet.sctp.blackhole=1
in /etc/sysctl.conf or knet will fail to work with SCTP.
This sysctl is obsoleted in version 13.

libnozzle requires if_tap.ko loaded in the kernel.

Please avoid to use ifconfig_DEFAULT in /etc/rc.conf to use
DHCP for all interfaces or the dhclient will interfere with
libnozzle interface management, causing errors on some
operations such as "ifconfig tap down".
